# Churn-Predication
Churn is defined in business terms as ‘when a client cancels a subscription to a service they have been using.’ A common example is people cancelling Spotify/Netflix subscriptions. So, Churn Prediction is essentially predicting which clients are most likely to cancel a subscription i.e ‘leave a company’ based on their usage of the service. Hence, the insights gained from Churn Prediction helps them to focus more on the customers that are at a high risk of leaving.
